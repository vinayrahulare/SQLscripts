/* SQL Server Agent Job Ownership */
/* The script below will return the SQL Server Agent Job name, whether or not the job is enabled or not and the current job owner.  
Once you run this code it would be wise to save the results as a point of reference.This query can also be customized to meet your needs 
if you only want to find non-compliant job owners based on logic in your environment.  Just add a WHERE clause to meet your needs. */
